            <dd>1991
                <br>
                After the death of his grandfather, Miller inherited $10,000 as part of a malpractice settlement. Miller opened a record store in Richmond, California called No Limit Records And Tapes, which later became the foundation for No Limit Records. 
                Beginning in 1991, the label released albums by Master P and the group TRU (The Real Untouchables), 
                a trio consisting of Miller and his brothers, Corey and Vyshonn, who also recorded as “C-Murder” and “Silkk the Shocker,” respectively.

            <dd>
                Miller was the first rapper to make $100 million and the first rap star to retain full ownership of his masters. He pioneered the artist-as-businessman prototype so prevalent in hip-hop today. After turning his Bay Area retail shop 
                No Limit Records into an independent label in the early 1990s, P moved his operation to his native Louisiana and, with a distribution deal through Priority Records, established a gangsta-rap dynasty that had the whole world saying his 
                trademark “Ugghhh!” In 1998, he earned an estimated $56.5 million, which landed him in the top 10 of Forbes magazines' list of highest-paid entertainers of the year.
