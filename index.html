        <h2>The Man Behind No Limit Records</h2>
            <p>Percy Miller, aka Master P, was born April 29, 1970 in New Orleans. The rapper, actor, and entrepreneur is also 
                the founder of the record label No Limit Records. Before he rose to fame in the 90s, he faced much adversity.
               Miller along with his four siblings grew up in a single-parent home in a neighborhood riddled with crime. Seeing his family struggle 
               to make ends meet motivated the rapper to strive for success. No one in his family could find work, so he created his own job.
            </p>
               <blockquote>"I was so hungry that my stomach was literally cramping."</blockquote>
            <p>
               In high school, he started selling cell phones as his first business venture. He also was a star player on the 
               basketball team, garnering him a scholarship to college to major in Business. He soon dropped out, but after inheriting money due to the death
               of his grandfather, he opened a record store, No Limit Records & Tapes.

        <h2>From Humble Beginnings to Stardom</h2>
            <p>The store grew into the record label <em>No Limit Records</em> and, under the monicker Master P, Miller
                released his first cassette tape in 1990. Unfortunately, he suffered another loss of a family member soon 
                after. This motivated Miller even more to become a great success. </p>

                <p>He branched out from being a rapper, exploring other business ventures. He was one of the first
                rappers to take advantage of the retail potential in the music industry. He invested in many businesses, such as Foot Locker, real estate, and 
                television production. He even starred in a television show with his son, Romeo Miller. He went on to own more record labels, 
               a film company, a clothing line, and the popular snack brand, Rap Snacks. 
               Master P is the ultimate businessman, something his younger self would be proud of.
